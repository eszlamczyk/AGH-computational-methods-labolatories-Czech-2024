industrial society and its future
introduction

1. the industrial revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human
race. they have greatly increased the life expectancy of those of us who live in
advanced countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling,
have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological
suffering (in the third world to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe
damage on the natural world. the continued development of technology will worsen
the situation. it will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict
greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption
and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in
advanced countries.
